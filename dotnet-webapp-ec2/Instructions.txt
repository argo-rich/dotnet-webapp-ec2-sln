TO DEPLOY THIS TO THE EC2 INSTANCE MANUALLY:

1. Publish the files to the "dotnet-webapp-ec2\publish" folder:  
a. Open Powershell from the project directory (E:\Documents\Code\source\repos\dotnet\dotnet-webapp-ec2-sln\dotnet-webapp-ec2)
b. Run the dotnet publish command:
	dotnet publish -o publish --os linux

2. SCP the published files to the EC2 instance using one of the following commands:
	COPY EVERYTHING:
	scp -rp -i ..\..\..\net-webapp-key.pem .\publish\* ec2-user@ec2-34-227-151-78.compute-1.amazonaws.com:~/dotnet-webapp-ec2

	COPY JUST CODE CHANGES (.cs or .cshtml (change "dotnet-webapp-ec2*" to copy specific file(s))):
	scp -i ..\..\..\net-webapp-key.pem .\publish\dotnet-webapp-ec2* ec2-user@ec2-34-227-151-78.compute-1.amazonaws.com:~/dotnet-webapp-ec2


TO RUN THE WEBAPP IN EC2:

1. Use Putty to SSH to the EC2 instance by loading the "Amazon EC2" saved session.
   (This uses the net-webapp-key.ppk to SSH to ec2-34-227-151-78.compute-1.amazonaws.com)
2. Run the following command (logs in /home/ec2-user/dotnet-webapp-ec2/logs):	
	/home/ec2-user/scripts/stop-dotnet-webapp-ec2.sh
	/home/ec2-user/scripts/start-dotnet-webapp-ec2.sh


LOAD WEBAPP IN BROWSER BY GOING TO:

http://ec2-34-227-151-78.compute-1.amazonaws.com:5000/

SSL CERTIFICATE:
In production the SSL cert is a PEM which is manually converted to a PFX.  The original PEM is obtained from
Let's Encrypt by running "sudo ./certbot certonly --standalone" from /opt/certbot/bin.  Below is the output:

"
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-84-71 bin]$ sudo ./certbot certonly --standalone
Saving debug log to /var/log/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.log
Please enter the domain name(s) you would like on your certificate (comma and/or
space separated) (Enter 'c' to cancel): northwind.argohaus.com

Successfully received certificate.
Certificate is saved at: /etc/letsencrypt/live/northwind.argohaus.com/fullchain.pem
Key is saved at:         /etc/letsencrypt/live/northwind.argohaus.com/privkey.pem
This certificate expires on 2025-03-05.
These files will be updated when the certificate renews.

NEXT STEPS:
- The certificate will need to be renewed before it expires. Certbot can automatically renew the certificate in the background, but you may need to take steps to enable that functionality. See https://certbot.org/renewal-setup for instructions.
"

To convert the cert to PFX, run the following command:
sudo openssl pkcs12 -export -out /etc/letsencrypt/live/northwind.argohaus.com/fullchain.pfx -inkey /etc/letsencrypt/live/northwind.argohaus.com/privkey.pem -in /etc/letsencrypt/live/northwind.argohaus.com/fullchain.pem


LESSONS LEARNED:
- Never use dashes in the name of a .NET app - use dots to separate words with Pascal case.  For 
  MVC, the dashes are replaced with underscores in some places, but dashes are kept in others.
